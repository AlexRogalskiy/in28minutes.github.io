### What is Docker?

Microservices in microservices architectures are written in multiple languages - Java, Python, JavaScript and more. However, you do not want to have deployment processes to be different for each type of microservices.

How can we have the flexibility of building microservices in multiple languages while having the same runtime and deployment process?

How about creating an application package that contains
- Microservice application package (jar or war or js or python code)
- and the runtime it needs (JRE or Python or NodeJS)

This package contains everything that a microservice needs to run. 

What does Docker do?
- Docker provides a common approach and format for building self contained packages for your microservices. Docker calls this package an image.
- Docker provides a runtime for running your image.

What does this enable?
- You can create Docker images for a wide variety of applications irrespective of their language, runtime or operating system.
- You can run Docker images (as containers) where ever Docker runtime is available.   

Are you ready to jump into the world of Docker?

### Why is Docker Popular?

Docker is popular because of the possibilites it opens for software delivery and deployment. Many common problems and inefficiences are resolved with containers.

The awesome thing about Docker is, you can easily install Docker on Cloud. Most of the cloud providers provide container based services
![alt text](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section02-getting-started-with-docker/resources/02-getting-started-with-docker-step06-001.png)

They provide services where you just need to provide a docker Image and it would automatically run on the cloud.

### The Virtual Machine Legacy

Before Docker, virutal machines were very popular.

The image below shows the typical architecture with a Virtual Machine
![alt text](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section02-getting-started-with-docker/resources/02-getting-started-with-docker-step06-002.png)

As you can see there are two operating systems present one is Guest OS and another is Host OS.

Due to this, virutal machine architecture becomes heavyweight. Hence you will not be able to benefit from the entire power of your hardware because of virutalization.

That is where Docker plays a significant role on consuming resources effectively.

![alt text](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section02-getting-started-with-docker/resources/02-getting-started-with-docker-step06-003.png)

with Docker, all that you need to run containers is a Docker Engine. Other main reasons why Docker is popular is:

#### Docker Images Are Self Sufficient

The Docker image contains all that is needed to run a container: the libraries, the software are directly part of these containers.

#### Docker is Light Weight

Because there is just one OS, the host OS, Docker is relatively lightweight and therefore, is very efficient. 

#### Docker Is Convenient For Cloud

All the cloud providers provide a number of container orchestration services around Docker.
- Azure provides a service called Azure Container Service. 
- AWS, Amazon Web Services, provides a service called Elastic Container Service and also AWS Fargate. 
- Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform. All Cloud Providers provide services around Kubernetes.

The rise of microservice architecture also one of the reason for Docker popularity.

### Understand Docker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker `daemon`, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. 

![Docker Architecture](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section02-getting-started-with-docker/resources/02-getting-started-with-docker-step05-001.png)

#### Docker daemon

The Docker daemon(dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

It is responsible for 

- Managing Containers
- Managing local Images
- Pulling images from the image registry if you need it
- Pushing a locally created image to an image registry

#### Docker Client

The Docker client``(docker)`` is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as ``docker run``, the client sends these commands to ``dockerd``, which carries them out. The ``docker`` command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

#### Docker Registry

A Docker ``registry`` stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry. If you use Docker DataCenter(DDC), it includes Docker Trusted Registry(DTR). 
When you use the ``docker pull`` or ``docker run`` commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the ``docker push`` command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.

#### Docker objects

When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. 
Some of those objects are 1. Images and 2. Containers.

- Images: An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. 

- Containers: A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.

### How to install Docker?

Docker makes the life of a developers and operations team simple.

Installing Docker today on most of the operating systems is really a cakewalk!

We recommend installing Docker Desktop on Mac and Windows.
- Mac - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
- Windows - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

On Linux, you can find instructions for your specific distribution at https://docs.docker.com/install/

For verify whether it has been installed or not, open command prompt and type following command:

``$ docker --version``

``Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea``

### What is Docker Registry?

A Docker registry contains a lot of repositories, different versions of various applications. Since Docker Hub is a public registry, anybody can access it.
Docker Registry is a commerical product that enables complete image management workflow, featuring LDAP Integration, image signing, security scannning, and integration with Universal Control Plane.

Typically, when we work in an enterprise, we use private repositories, so that our images can only be accessed by somebody who has the right credentials.

### How to create Docker Hello World Rest API Image and Pushed to Registry?

The complete project is located at https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-crash-course/tree/master/01-hello-world-rest-api.

You can clone or download the entire github repository and import this project as a maven project into eclipse.

Here is the screenshot of the project setup in Eclipse.

![alt text](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step01-001.png)

If you are new to Spring and Spring Boot, you can watch these - [Spring in 10 Steps](https://courses.in28minutes.com/p/spring-framework-for-beginners) and [Spring Boot in 10 Steps](https://courses.in28minutes.com/p/spring-boot-for-beginners-in-10-steps) to understand how Spring and Spring Boot work together.

Let's now build a Docker image for the Hello World Rest API. Let's start with following a manual approach to create the image.

### Step 1 : Create a JAR File

The first thing we need to do is build a JAR for the application. This particular application is packaged as a JAR file.

Building a JAR file should be really easy. All that you need to is do a clean Maven build, by say saying ```mvn clean package```. 

**pom.xml :**

```

		<groupId>com.in28minutes.rest.webservices</groupId>
		<artifactId>01-hello-world-rest-api</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
		<packaging>jar</packaging>
		<description>Demo project for Spring Boot</description>
		<name>hello-world-rest-api</name>
		<parent>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
			<version>2.1.7.RELEASE</version>
			<relativePath /> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
		</parent>
```

This would compile the code, run the unit tests, and finally, a JAR would be packaged. 

![image info](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step02-003.png)
![image info](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step02-004.png)

The name of the JAR is ```hello-world-rest-api.jar```, and it is under the ```target``` folder. 

The name of the JAR is coming in from ```pom.xml```. If you search for something called ```FinalName``` in the build, we are configuring a name for this specific JAR, hello-world-rest-api.jar. 

**pom.xml :**

```

	<build>
		<finalName>hello-world-rest-api</finalName>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>

	</build>


```
### Step 2 : Decide the right base image

The second thing would be to setup the prerequisites for running the JAR file.
We need Java installed, and we'll use a ```OpenJDK``` image, such as ```openjdk:8-jdk-alpine```. This is the most popular image used to run Java 8. 

> Alpine images is based on AlpineLinux to keep the size of the image down.

Let's now run the alpine jdk image.

`docker run -dit openjdk:8-jdk-alpine`.

> ```-dit``` > ```-d``` is actually something which allows us to run the container in a detached mode. The container is running but we want to be able to execute the commands in using an interactive shell. With `-it`, we are attaching a interactive shell to the running container. This allows us to execute a command against the running container.

```openjdk:8-jdk-alpine``` image will be dowloaded from Docker Hub. It would take a little while as it is a large - ```100 MB``` download. 

You can run `docker images` to see the downloaded image.
![alt text](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step02-007.png)

Run ```docker container ls``` to see the running container -  ```naughty_knuth```. 

### Step 3 : Copy the JAR File into Docker Image

The third step is to copy the JAR into the specific image. Then, we would want to be able to run the JAR as part of the container. Let's get started with all that right now. 

#### Copying The JAR File

Here's the command to copy a jar file into the container:

`docker container cp target/hello-world-rest-api.jar naughty_knuth:/tmp`
![image info](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step02-008.png)
![image info](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step02-009.png)
![image info](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step02-010.png)
ou can also use the ID of the container. 

`docker container cp target/hello-world-rest-api.jar 54cf414254e48d5f68c4d468b2dd4cbdd95d17f9e2074fdb9df7f64987697f2b:/tmp`

The command successfully executed, which means our JAR file is now copied into the running container. 

Let's see what is inside the container:

```docker container exec naughty_knuth ls /tmp```. 

You will see the jar file - ```hello-world-rest-api.jar```

### Step 4 : Running The JAR Within The Container 

Now, we would want to run this JAR. Before that, we need to do two simple steps. 

#### Saving The Container Image

The first step is, actually to save the container which we have created, as a image. 

Here's the command:
```docker container commit naughty_knuth in28min/hello-world-rest-api:manual1```

We are giving a repository name of ```in28min/hello-world-rest-api``` and a tag of ```manual1```.

If you run `docker images` you would see a new image.

#### Running The Image

Let's see if we can run this image. 

```docker run in28min/hello-world-rest-api:manual1```

Let's see if there are anything running at this point in time.

```docker container ls```. 

You will see that the container which we launched just is not really running at all!

How can we get it to run the application?

#### Attaching The JAR To Startup

The reason it is not running is we did not attach anything to run at launch of the container. 

We would want to launch a java application jar at startup of the container. We copied the JAR file into this image, but did not specify that the JAR file has to be launched at startup. 

How can we do that?

`docker container commit --change='CMD ["java","-jar","/tmp/hello-world-rest-api.jar"]' naughty_knuth in28min:hello-world-rest-api:manual2`

We are adding a startup command by using an option ```--change```. 

![image info](https://github.com/in28minutes/docker-course-with-java-and-spring-boot-articles/blob/master/section04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-with-docker/resources/04-containerizing-java-spring-boot-hello-world-rest-api-step02-011.png)

#### Running The Container Again

Let's do ```docker images```, and a new image is seen to be created with tag as ```manual2```. Now, we can run it saying ```docker run in28min/hello-world-rest-api:manual2```. We would also want to publish the port, as in ```8080:8080```. 

```docker run -p 8080:8080 in28min/hello-world-rest-api:manual2```

> If you have any container running on 8080, you can stop it.

If we go to the browser and refresh, the URL continues to work.
